# World-Advanced-Multi-Health-Research-Initiatives: Pioneering a Decentralized Advanced Health Research and Fostering Sustainable Solutions for a Healthier World

This repository serves as a collaborative hub for the World Advanced Multi-Health Research Initiatives (WAMHRI), a collective dedicated to advancing decentralized health research for the benefit of humanity. WAMHRI focuses on interdisciplinary and modern technologies such as Web3, Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain approaches to tackle complex global health challenges, promote evidence-based practices, and strengthen healthcare systems, particularly in developing countries.

Our Mission

WAMHRI aims to:
1.	To create decentralized, high-quality and durable health research education system that has goals and principles aligning either directly or indirectly with 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations
2.	To teach advanced research methods and techniques to all enthusiastic people whose goals are to ensure attainment of excellent health, effective and efficient health care, and a better world for all.
3.	To perform health research using advanced research methods to ensure attainment of excellent health, effective and efficient health care, and a better world for all.
4.	To favor turning all proven and promising discoveries and innovative approaches into healthcare practical benefit to ensure attainment of excellent health, effective and efficient health care, and a better world for all.
5.	To organize scientific events to share scientific information, aiming to ensure the attainment of excellent health, effective and efficient health care, and a better world for all.
6.	To support health-related organizations in generating timely technical reports.
7.	To teach and encourage the usage of ethics, bioethics, and healthcare bioethical principles.
	
Our Vision
WAMHRI envision to be a decentralized nucleus of world health data science and intensive health research platform that aptly support evidence-based healthcare which is a top-rated strategy to ensure excellent health, effective, efficiency health care and a better world for all.
